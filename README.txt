TO DO

1) constructor for track_manager5() not working in main{} -- done
2) correct function reducedFrequency5 in test_tracking.cpp; currently returning empty tracks_ -- done
3) if-else added to the function evaluateTracking() giving wrong RMS values --
4) reducedFrequency is only copying the reduced frames from 10Hz track to 5Hz track and members label_ and serialization_version_, what about the member track_num_ -- done
5) commented out check lines in main, resolve pointer issue -- done
